      <p>A little sweet, a lot sassy, and just the right amount of soggy fries.</p>

      <p>We are The Third Option—a Harold-ish improv troupe doing the dang thing on Zoom.</p>

      <p>Catch us online in our upcoming sets, which are all free to watch from the comfort of your couch, bed, bathtub… hey, live it up during the weird times, friends!</p>

      <p><a href="https://umich.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_cCuqps6ctQ8cvrw">Join us on stage at a future event!</a></p>

      <h2>Watch Us Live While Safe at Home</h2>

      <p>#Zoomprov is alive and well in 2021. Let’s embrace it! If you haven't tuned in to a virtual improv show, it takes about 2 minutes to get used to it. Then, you’ll be sucked right in just like you’re in a theatre. (Oh, stages. We miss you.) But this is what we got for now, so we’re making the most of it!</p>
